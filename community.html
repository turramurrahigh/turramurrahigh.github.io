            Our Students in the Community
        </h1>
        <p>
            Students at Turramurra High School are active participants in our local and wider community. As a high profile public school,
            we value our community partnerships and recognize that our students are a reflection and product of our community.
            <br>
            <br> Our students are involved in numerous community projects each year including the Salvation Army Red Shield Appeal,
            Premier's Volunteering program, and the Turramurra branch of Bendigo Bank Youth Leadership project.
            <br>
            <br>Our school has a long tradition of supporting three key charity organisations; Red Kite, the Muscular Dystrophy
            Association and the Leukemia Foundation.
            <br>
            <br>In recent years, we have established global community connections with a community in Northern India where we
            are contributing to the building of a high school.
            <br>
            <br> Students of Turramurra High School recognize the value of citizenship and we are very proud of the contribution
            that our students make to our local community.
