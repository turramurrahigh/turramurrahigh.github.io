        <p>
            Turramurra High School welcomes both International and Exchange students from a variety of countries. We are recognised for
            our strong and well-established International Students’ Program.
            <br>
            <br> We are a culturally diverse school which encourages the interaction between students with various culture and
            backgrounds. The school embraces this opportunity for international and local students to exchange cultures and
            enjoy this cross-cultural experience.
            <br>
            <br> Our teachers are committed and determined to provide every student with a positive learning environment. Staff
            provide every assistance in helping each student pursue and fulfil their academic and personal achievements.
            <br>
            <br> At Turramurra High School, international students are supported by the International coordinator, Liaison Officers,
            specialist ESL teachers, Year Advisors, School Counsellor and members of the teaching staff. We believe that
            the potential of a student is maximised with the appropriate support. The dedicated team composed of the International
            Student Coordinator and Liaison Officers support each students’ well being, academic performance and attendance,
            and provide guidance and advice to students.
            <br>
            <br> In addition to all the local Australian student activities and services the International students also have
            access to additional English tutoring, the ESL Support Centre, tutoring in various subjects, the International
            Student University Expo, barbeques, excursions and cultural / sociaI events.
