            Year 8
        </h1>
        <p>
            Year 8 at Turramurra High School is a year characterised by growth and change as our students continue to build on the skills
            and knowledge in each key learning area. Our Year 8 students are actively involved in our band program, singing
            groups and seek leadership opportunities on the Student Representative Council (SRC). Year 8 is a year where
            we encourage students to make the most of all the opportunities offered to them at Turramurra High School. Academically,
            it is important that students build on their study skills and continue to develop their skills in lifelong learning
            over their six years at high school. At Turramurra High, we believe in encouraging every student to reach their
            personal, social and academic best by providing individualised learning and numerous extra-curricular activities
            for students to choose from. Year 8 Camp occurs in term 4 each year. It is a much anticipated activity and students
            thoroughly enjoy the outdoor games and challenges that the camp offers. It is also an opportunity to expand friendship
            groups and strengthen those already established.
