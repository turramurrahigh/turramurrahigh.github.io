            Year 11
        </h1>
        <p>
            Year 11 marks the commencement of the Higher School Certificate qualification. Students will start their Preliminary HSC
            year with a combination of courses that they have selected for themselves from the broad range of curriculum
            choices on offer at Turramurra High School. As a member of the North Shore Secondary Schools Partnership, students
            at Turramurra High also have the opportunity to choose courses that may be offered at another of the schools
            in the partnership thereby expanding the curriculum choices exponentially. Our partnership with Killara, Ku-ring-gai,
            St Ives and Chatswood High Schools means that our students gain the combined expertise and resources of five
            high schools rather than one. In term 2 of Year 11, students have the opportunity to nominate for the student
            leadership team and Prefect body. These prestigious leadership positions are highly sought after and carry much
            responsibility. Our student leaders are actively involved in school decision-making. Our student leaders are
            represented in three teams; social justice, student welfare and our environment teams. These groups continue
            to have a powerful influence on the culture of Turramurra high School through their highly successful leadership
            activities and projects. At Turramurra High School we encourage and support every student to develop their ability
            to plan and use time effectively and gain the high level of skills necessary to achieve their academic best.
            Our committed and dedicated teaching staff have a high level of expertise in their subject knowledge and mentor
            each student on their HSC journey.
