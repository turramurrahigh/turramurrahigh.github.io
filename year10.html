            Year 10
        </h1>
        <p>
            Year 10 is an important year in many ways. Students are able to gain valuable insights into planning for their future through
            our Work Experience program and ‘Giving Back’ student volunteering program. Every Year 10 student gains enormous
            benefit of regular careers lessons which assist them in the practical skills of preparing a curriculum vitae
            but also help with goal setting and discerning a pathway for their future. Year 10 is a year where we encourage
            students to develop independence of thought and action, to take responsibility for their own learning and continue
            to develop the important study skills for their senior years of high school. Along with the leadership opportunities
            offered by the Student Representative Council, students can be nominated as leaders in the peer support program
            to mentor Year 7 students through their transition to high school. Every year Turramurra High School nominates
            up to twenty Year 10 students to participate in the Global Young Leaders Conference for the following year. The
            nominated students attend the GYLC Conference in New York, China or at various European locations and interact
            with young leaders from all over the world. This invaluable experience creates lifelong memories and builds outstanding
            leadership skills in our students. Another feature of Year 10 is our annual Urban Challenge Camp. The Urban Challenge
            is a unique, innovative and adventurous program developed to engage students in the urban Sydney landscape, to
            work as a team and to learn whilst having fun. There are countless benefits from The Urban Challenge; real world
            independence, discovering new skills, taking responsibility for themselves and others in the group, skills transference,
            confidence, and discovering new places.
