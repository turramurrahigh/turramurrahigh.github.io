            Placement in Year 7 at Turramurra High School is highly sought after by families in our wider community. Year 7 is an exciting
            year of transition and new opportunities for our students. We offer a range of orientation activities for new
            students including an outstanding peer support program where student leaders in Year 10, mentor our new Year
            7 students and assist them to get to know each other and our great school. Year 7 Camp occurs in term one every
            year and is a great opportunity for students to establish lifelong friendships and to get to know their caring
            and dedicated teachers. There are always exciting stories of canoe trips, high ropes course and night time concerts
            to share upon return. Year 7 Recognition Evening occurs in term two each year and is always an exciting night
            where we celebrate the success of every one of our Year 7 students. It is also an opportunity for students to
            recognise those people who have had a positive influence in their lives and in their success. By the end of Year
            7 our students are able to look back on a year of new experiences, new friendships and exciting opportunities
            to enhance their future learning.
